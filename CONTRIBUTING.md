## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

We use ESLint with specific rules for Chrome extensions:

- **Use ES6+ features** where appropriate
- **Use const/let** instead of var
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Follow the existing code style**

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Tests must pass**: All existing tests must continue to pass
- **Lint checks**: Code must pass ESLint validation
- **Test coverage**: New features should include tests
- **Manual testing**: Test your changes in the browser

### File Organization

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html/js          # Popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js             # Content script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js          # Service worker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css             # Content styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                  # External libraries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/               # Extension assets
```

### Testing Guidelines

- **Write unit tests** for new functions
- **Include integration tests** for user flows
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Mock Chrome APIs** properly in tests

Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  test('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
