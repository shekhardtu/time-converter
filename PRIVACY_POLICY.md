# Privacy Policy for Timezone Converter

**Last updated:** June 20, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how the Timezone Converter Chrome Extension (the "Extension") handles your data.

### 1. Data We Do Not Collect

We believe in privacy by design. This Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)** about you. We do not track your browsing history, your location, or any other personal data.

### 2. Data We Store Locally

The Extension uses the `chrome.storage.sync` API to save your preferences and improve your experience. This data is stored locally in your browser and is synced to your personal Google account, but it is **never transmitted to us or any third party**.

The data we store includes:

*   **Selected Timezones:** Your chosen "from" and "to" timezones are saved so you don't have to select them every time you use the extension.
*   **Custom Date Formats:** Any custom date formats you create for specific websites are stored to enable automatic conversion on those sites.

This data is essential for the core functionality of the Extension and is managed entirely by you within your browser.

### 3. Permissions Justification

The Extension requires certain permissions to function, all of which are used solely to provide the intended features:

*   **`activeTab` / `tabs` / `scripting`:** To run the date conversion script on the current webpage when you activate the extension.
*   **`storage`:** To save your timezone preferences and custom formats as described above.
*   **Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`):** To allow the extension to work on any website where you might need to convert time.

### 4. No Third-Party Sharing

We do not share any data with any third parties. All data handled by the Extension remains within your browser.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
